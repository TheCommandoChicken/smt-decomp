# SMT1-Decomp
A very WIP decompilation of Shin Megami Tensei 1 for the Playstation.

## Why?
- The classic SMT games (with the exception of 1) have yet to be released in the west, and none of them have been re-released on PC, even via an emulated release.
- The goal of this project is not strictly to obtain a codebase that recompiles into the original executable with no differences, but rather to simply reverse engineer the code enough that a PC port of the three classic games (SMT1, SMT2, and If...) can be made, with optional enhancements that would be difficult to implement as a hack.
- That being said, those who _are_ interested in code matching are welcome to contribute to this repo.
- The other reason for this project is that I have a personal interest in these games, and wanted to learn more about how they work under the hood.
